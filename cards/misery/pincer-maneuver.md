# Pincer Maneuver {#title}

Spawn an extra Horde unit following round rules. This spawned unit deep strikes outside of 3" from all player units within the Defending Player deployment zone if able, otherwise within No Man's Land. Within the Attacking Player's deployment zone as a last resort. 

(This unit counts as having entered via deep strike during the Horde's movement phase for all rules purposes.)
