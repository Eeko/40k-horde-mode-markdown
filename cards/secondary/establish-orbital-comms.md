# Establish Orbital Comms {#title}

In your shooting phase, select a unit within 6” of the center of the battlefield that is not Battle-shocked and eligible to shoot.  Until the end of turn that unit is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge.

At the end of your turn if that unit is within 6” of the center of the battlefield this mission is successful.

## Success {#secondary-success}

One at a time, each player without a revealed Secret Objective immediately uses **A Change of Plans**.

## Failure {#secondary-failure}

The same as **Success** but players do not choose a card, instead they get one at random.
