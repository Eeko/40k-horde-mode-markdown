# Reinforcement Points Purchase Table {#title}

## A Name Earned, 1 RP

Add an enhancement to a character without one. Follow all Index/Codex rules. For each player, only one copy of any enhancement may exist at once.

## Basic Tactics, 2 RP

Gain 1CP.

## Share Supplies, 3 RP

Grant 2RP to another player.

## Air Strike, 3 RP

Select one piece of terrain. Each unit within it takes 2D3 mortal wounds, then remove the piece of terrain from the battlefield.

## Fortify Positions, 4 RP

Set up a ruin anywhere on the battlefield, it cannot have a footprint overlapping any other, must not have walls that cover the base of any model already on the battlefield, and has a maximum dimensions of 9" by 9". (Maximum one use per turn for the entire team.)

## Tempt Fate, 4 RP

Add a second secondary to the pool.  You fail/pass secondaries individually, their rewards stack, but no more than two can be active in any round. (Maximum one use per turn for the whole team.)

## Supply Drop, 5 RP

Add a new objective to No Man's Land, 6" from board edge, 6" from all others. (Maximum 6 objective markers in play at once.)

## Advanced Tactics, 5 RP

Remove one secondary and reveal a new one. (Maximum one use per turn for the whole team.)

## Field Promotion, 6 RP

Destroy a unit you own that is not in combat. Roll 2d6+1 and select a unit of your choice from the corresponding bracket of your army's spawning table. You may pick a unit of any model count to upgrade into, but you may not place more models in the new unit than were in the destroyed unit. Set up that unit on the battlefield as close as possible to the original unit's position. The unit may not be set up within engagement range of any enemy models.

## Patched Up, 6 RP

Return a unit you own that is not in combat to its starting strength, including any lost attached characters.

## Reinforcements Arrive, 10 RP

Roll 2d6 and select a unit of your choice from the corresponding bracket of your army's spawning table to add to your Reserves. (They may enter this turn.)  If no unit within that spawning bracket is available you may instead select two units of the next lower bracket instead.

## A change of Plans, 10 RP

Draw up to 2 cards from the Secret Objective deck.  Choose one of your secret objectives. Place all but the chosen Secret Objective card back onto the Secret Objective deck face down, then shuffle the deck.
